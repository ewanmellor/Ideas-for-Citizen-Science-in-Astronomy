\begin{abstract} 

We review the expanding, internet-enabled, and rapidly-evolving field of citizen
astronomy, focusing on research projects in stellar, extragalactic and 
planetary science that have benefited from the participation of members of the
public. These volunteers contribute in various ways: making and analyzing new
observations, visually classifying features in images and light curves,
exploring models constrained by astronomical datasets, and initiating new
scientific enquiries.  The most productive citizen astronomy projects involve
close collaboration between the professionals and amateurs involved, and occupy
scientific niches not easily filled by great observatories or machine learning
methods: citizen astronomers are motivated by being of service to science, as
well as by their interest in the subject. We expect participation and
productivity in citizen astronomy to increase, as datasets get larger and
citizen science platforms more efficient. Opportunities include engaging
citizens in ever-more advanced analyses, and facilitating citizen-led enquiry
through professional tools designed with citizens in mind.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:intro}

The term ``citizen science'' refers to the activities of people who are not paid
to carry out scientific research (``citizens''), but who make intellectual
contributions to scientific research nonetheless.\footnote{%
In this review we differentiate between the data collection and data analysis to
which citizens contribute, and distributed ``grid'' computing farmed out to
processors owned by citizens. We omit the latter since it does not fit our
definition of citizen science as involving \textit{intellectual} contributions
from citizens; the Oxford English Dictionary defines citizen science as 
``\textit{scientific work} undertaken by members of the general public, often in
collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and
scientific institutions'' (our emphasis).} Citizen scientists come from all walks
of life, and their contributions are diverse, both in type and research area.
This review is about the astronomy projects they have participated in to date,
the tasks they have performed, and how astronomy has benefited -- and could
benefit further -- from their efforts.

The earliest
example of collaboration between professional and amateur astronomers seems to
have been Edmund Halley's call for observations of the 1715 total eclipse of the
Sun which crossed central England \citep{Halley}.\footnote{Citizen observations proved useful; Halley's colleagues at
Oxford were clouded out, and those in Cambridge were ``oppressed by too much
Company, so that, though the heavens were very favourable, [they] missed both
the time of the beginning of the Eclipse and that of total darkness.''}  Since
then there has been a long tradition of amateur observers
making important discoveries and significant sustained contributions. However,
the advent of the world wide web has changed the face of professional and
amateur collaboration, providing new opportunities and accelerating the sharing
of information. People are now connected to each other on a scale that has never
happened before. Citizens can interact with professional scientists via a range
of media, including purpose-built citizen science websites which
increase the potential for shared data analysis and exploration, as well as for
data collection. Meanwhile, communities of citizens have sprung into existence
as like-minded people have been able to find and talk to each other in a way
that is almost independent of their geographical location. The result has been
an exponential increase in citizen involvement in science. The field is evolving
very quickly, with more and more professional scientists becoming aware of the
possibilities offered by collaborating with, for example, specialists operating
outside the usual parameters of professional astronomical observation, or tens
of thousands of people eager to perform microtasks in their spare time.  

Our aim in this work is to review the astronomical (and occasionally wider)
literature for productive citizen science projects, and distill the
characteristics that made these case studies successful.  As our title states,
this is a review of ideas for astronomy: we will look forward as well as back,
and try to answer the following questions. What are the particular niches that
citizen science fills, in our field? What traits do successful citizen astronomy
projects share? What is the potential of citizen science in
astronomy, and how can it be realized?  Citizen science has a significant impact
on its participants,  whether they be sitting in a university office or in front
of a home computer or mobile phone screen. 

This review is organised as follows. Astronomy research typically starts with
observations: so do we, in \Sref{sec:obs}. We then proceed to consider visual
classification, data modeling and finally citizen-led enquiry in 
Sections~\ref{sec:class}--\ref{sec:explore}. With this overview in place, we
take a look in \Sref{sec:crowd} at the population of citizens who take part in
astronomical research. 
In \Sref{sec:future} we speculate on potential citizen contributions to
astronomy in the future, and finish with some
concluding remarks in \Sref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{AMATEUR OBSERVING}
\label{sec:obs}

There is currently an active community of well-equipped amateur observers
making astronomical observations of great utility. The steady improvements and
increasing affordability of digital technology, in addition to the ease of
data sharing and communications, have considerably expanded the realm of
amateur astronomy in the past two decades.  Meanwhile, professional
observatories are always over-subscribed, with resources necessarily being
divided between particular areas of sky, or samples of objects, or on a few
astronomical questions: tuning the parameters of professional observations to
optimize all possible scientific enquiries would seem an impossible task. What
types of  niches does this leave for amateur observers to fill? What are the
strengths that amateur observers can play to?

% Solar System Observations

\CaseStudy{Discovery and characterisation of asteroids and comets.}
Small solar system objects moving against the fixed-star background can be
detected in a set of CCD frames either by eye or by automated software.
Targets include near-earth asteroids (NEAs, with orbits intersecting those of
the terrestrial planets), main belt asteroids between Mars and Jupiter, and
comets. The extreme familiarity of some citizen astronomers with a particular
region of sky, planet or nebula, allows them to immediately identify
peculiarities or new features.  A protocol for citizen discovery has been
established: the position of any new object is compared to existing
catalogues, and if no existing details are found then the new discovery and
its ephemerides can be reported to the IAU Minor Planet
Center.\footnote{\url{http://www.minorplanetcenter.net}} If observations are
repeated for at least two nights by one or several observers, then a new
denomination is provisionally assigned to the discovery, and an electronic
circular reports the discovery to the wider world. For example, the NEA
2012~DA14 was initially reported by a team of amateur observers affiliated
with the La Sagra Sky Survey at the Astronomical Observatory of Mallorca
(Spain), and subsequently characterised by professional astronomers during its
closest approach in February 2013 \citep[e.g., ][]{13deleon}.

As with asteroids, the majority of new comet discoveries are made by automated
surveys, but a small and stable number of discoveries come from amateurs with
small telescopes \citep{14mousis_proam}, typically in regions poorly covered
by survey telescopes (e.g., regions close to the Sun).   C/2011~W3~(Lovejoy),
a Kreutz sungrazer comet, is one such example, discovered by T. Lovejoy and
circulated via the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT)
\citep[e.g.,][]{12sekanina}.  The Oort cloud comet C/2012~S1~(ISON) was
spotted by V. Nevski and A. Novichonok in images from the International
Scientific Optical Network, which spurred a major international effort to
observe its perihelion passage as it disintegrated \citep{14sekanina}.   At
the time of writing, an international citizen network, managed via the
`Co-ordinated  Observations of Comets (CIOC)' 
group\footnote{\url{http://cometcampaign.org/comet-siding-spring}},  is hoping
to provide worldwide coverage of the close approach of C/2013A Siding  Spring
with Mars in Oct 2014.  Amateurs are also contributing to the search for a
sub-category of objects with a detectable cometary coma within the asteroid
belt.  Recent discoveries of these main belt comets, which appear to be
asteroids that are actively venting their volatiles at perihelion, are
beginning to blur the distinction between asteroids and comets.  The T3
project, a collaboration between the University of Rome and several amateur
observers, began in 2005 with the detection of a coma around asteroid
2005~SB216 \citep{06buzzi}, and has gone on to detect at least eight main belt
comets \citep{14mousis_proam}.  These early citizen science discoveries,
followed up by professional astronomers, have generated new insights into the
properties and variety of comets, and the dynamic and evolving nature of our
solar system.  The discovery of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (co-discovered by
amateur observer D. Levy) before its collision with Jupiter
\citep{04harrington} is a classic example. In general, it is the global
distribution of citizen observers and the long-baselines of their observations
that enable new discoveries of minor bodies in our solar system.

\CaseStudy{Long timescale planet monitoring.}
Planetary atmospheres make tantalising targets for citizen observers, being
large, bright, colourful and highly variable from night to night (e.g., 
\Fref{fig:planets}).  The long-term monitoring provided by the network of
amateur astronomers provides valuable insights into the meteorology of these
worlds, tracking the motions of clouds, waves and storms as they are
transported by atmospheric winds to probe the physical and chemical processes
shaping their climates.  For example, the global distribution of giant planet
observers permits global monitoring of Jupiter and Saturn as they rotate over
10 hours. Citizens upload raw filtered images and colour composites, organised
by date and time, to online servers, such as the Planetary Virtual Observatory
and Laboratory (PVOL\footnote{\url{http://www.pvol.ehu.es/pvol}}) maintained
for the International Outer Planets Watch \citep[IOPW][]{10hueso}.  Those
images can be used by amateurs and professionals alike to study quantitatively
the visible activity, including  measuring wind speeds from erupting plumes
\citep{08sanchez}, investigating the strength and changes to the large
vortices \citep[e.g., the 2006 reddening of Jupiter's Oval
BA,][]{06simon-miller}, and determining the life cycle of the belt/zone
structure \citep{96sanchez, 11fletcher_fade}.  For Saturn, a close
collaboration between citizen scientists and Cassini spacecraft scientists
(known as Saturn Storm Watch) has allowed correlation of lightning-related
radio emissions detected by the spacecraft with visible cloud structures on
the disc \citep[e.g.,][]{11fischer}, which would not have been possible with
the targeted regional views provided by Cassini's cameras alone. Furthermore,
it was the amateur community that first spotted the eruption of Saturn's
enormous 2010-2011 storm system, which was monitored over several months
\citep{12sanchez}.

Video monitoring has been used by citizen observers to enable high resolution
``lucky'' imaging of Jupiter. The best images, at moments of clear seeing,
from the high-resolution video frames are selected, extracted and stacked
together, using custom software to correct for the distortions associated with
the telescope optics and residual atmospheric seeing.  Software written by
citizen scientists for free distribution to active observers, such as
Registax\footnote{\url{http://www.astronomie.be/registax}} and
Autostakkert\footnote{\url{http://www.autostakkert.com}},  allows them to
process their own video files, thus avoiding the need for transfer of large
datasets to some centralised server \citep[see][for a thorough
review]{14mousis_proam}.  Descriptive records of morphological changes are
maintained and continuously updated by organisations of citizen scientists
such as the British Astronomical Association (BAA) and the Association of
Lunar and Planetary Observers (ALPO and ALPO-Japan). The BAA's Jupiter
section\footnote{\url{http://www.britastro.org/jupiter}} is a team of amateurs
with substantial expertise in Jupiter's appearance \citep{95rogers};  their
regular bulletins describe the changing appearance of the banded structure and
the emergence of new turbulent structures and weather phenomena, and keep a
record of the long-term atmospheric changes.  

Amateur observing also provides long-term monitoring in the inner solar
system.  Discrete cloud features can be used to study the super-rotation of
the Venusian atmosphere, and the occurrence of a mysterious ultraviolet
absorber at high altitudes.  For example, the Venus Ground-Based Image Active
Archive was created by ESA to provide contextual observations supporting the
Venus Express mission \citep{08barentsen}.   Groups such as the International
Society of Mars Observers
(ISMO\footnote{\url{http://www.mars.dti.ne.jp/\textasciitilde
cmo/ISMO.html}}), the British Astronomical Association (BAA) and the
International Mars Watch program quantitatively and qualitatively assess 
amateur images of the red planet, and while citizen observations of Uranus and
Neptune require telescopes with diameters exceeding 25 cm, there have been
confirmed reports of atmospheric banding and discrete cloud features when
near-infrared filters  (to maximise the contrast between the white clouds and
the dark background) and long exposure times of tens of minutes are used.  
Citizen monitoring of all of these worlds (summarised in \Fref{fig:planets})
provides the long-baseline, flexible and high frequency imaging complementary
to that returned by orbital and surface missions.

\CaseStudy{Solar System Impacts.}
The increasing adoption of video monitoring of planetary targets means that
unexpected, short-lived events on the surfaces of those bodies  are now more
likely to be observed by citizen astronomers than by professional
observatories.  For example, an impact scar near Jupiter's south polar region
was first discovered in imaging by Australian amateur Anthony Wesley on July
19th, 2009. This led to an international campaign of professional observations
to understand the asteroidal collision that had created the scar
\citep[e.g.,][]{10hammel,10depater,11orton}.  Although the 2009 impact was out
of view from the Earth, at least three flashes have been confirmed between
2010 and 2012, and the light curves used to determine the sizes and frequency
of objects colliding with Jupiter \citep[e.g.,][]{13hueso}
(\Fref{fig:jupiter-impacts}).  Citizen scientists have developed free software
to allow observers to search for impact flashes in an automated way (e.g.,
Jupiter impact detections\footnote{\url{http://www.pvol.ehu.es/software}} and
LunarScan from the ALPO Lunar Meteoritic Impact Search for transient impact
flashes recorded on the
Moon\footnote{\url{http://alpo-astronomy.org/lunarupload/lunimpacts.htm}}).

\CaseStudy{Transiting and Microlensing Exoplanets.}  
Amateur observers have contributed to several exoplanet investigations,
responding to detections made by professional surveys and making important
contributions to the light curves of the targets. In the case of exoplanet
transits, the challenge is to measure the 1\% diminution in starlight as a
giant planet transits in front of its parent star. \citet{14mousis_proam}
point out three methods whereby amateurs can contribute to the
characterisation of exoplanetary systems: first, by frequent observations of
known transits to refine ephemeris; second, by searching for transit time
variations that can reveal additional planets in a system; and third, by
searching for previously unidentified transits in known planetary systems
\citep[e.g., the discovery of the transit of HD 80606b from a 30 cm telescope
near London,][]{09fossey}.  A further interesting example of citizen
contribution to exoplanet observations is the characterisation of the transit
candidate KOI-961 \citep{Muirhead2012},  during which amateur astronomer Kevin
Apps pointed out to  the professional observing  team the close similarity of
the stellar spectrum to that of Barnard's star, enabling them to carry out an
unusually sensitive differential analysis. 

In a planetary microlensing event, significant brightening of the background
star is required to make a planet orbiting the microlens visible at all; if
additional caustic crossings are caused, the resulting exoplanetary
microlensing feature is of just several days duration, calling for high
frequency, on demand monitoring -- a situation well matched to the capability
of a global network of small telescope observers \citep[see e.g.\
][]{Christie2006}. High magnification events detected by the 
OGLE\footnote{\url{http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/}} and
MOA\footnote{\url{http://www.phys.canterbury.ac.nz/moa}} surveys have been
broadcast by the
microFUN\footnote{\url{http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/\textasciitilde
microfun}} and PLANET\footnote{\url{http://planet.iap.fr}} networks (now
merged) to globally-distributed professional and amateur observers to follow
up. These collaborations have been very successful, helping enable
characterisation of over a dozen exoplanet systems \citep[see e.g.\ ][and
references therein]{Udalski++2005,Gould++2014}. (A similarly responsive
network of citizen observertories is assembling as the RECON project, which
aims to measure the size of Kuiper belt objects from the width of their
occultation shadows as they pass over the West coast of the
U.S.\footnote{\url{http://tnorecon.net/}})

\CaseStudy{Variable Star Monitoring: the AAVSO.}
The American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) supports and
coordinates the efforts of about 2000 amateurs (over a five-year window) who
are interested in monitoring variable stars.  In each of the last five years,
the community has made over a million observations, either visually or with
digital techniques, and logged them into a shared, public
database\footnote{\url{http://www.aavso.org}} with over 100 years of
continuous data on many stars.  The AAVSO provides a number of services to
assist the volunteers, including training material, an online data entry tool
that carries out basic error checking, finding charts with calibrated
photometry, a catalog of known variable stars that is more extensive than the
General Catalog of Variable Stars (GCVS), and data analysis tools such as
light curve generation and period determination.  Staff and volunteers perform
quality control on the submitted data.  Despite its name, AAVSO observers are
located all over the world, with two thirds of the observer base residing
outside of the U.S.  Some of the community's larger telescopes can be operated
robotically, and have been linked together into a network, AAVSOnet.  The
AAVSO is also engaged in the NSF-funded AAVSO Photometric All-Sky Survey
(APASS\footnote{\url{http://www.aavso.org/apass}}), a survey of the entire sky
in 8 bandpasses ($BVu'g'r'i'z'Y$) for stars between 7th and 17th magnitude. 
The APASS data processing and calibration is being done in collaboration with
professional astronomers, and the data is being released at approximately
annual intervals.

The distributed nature of the AAVSO community means that it can produce
continuous light curves for stars at all declinations.  The AAVSO data has
been used extensively by professional astronomers needing the most up-to-date
optical measurements of stellar variability in, for example, the SS Cyg system
\citep{Miller-Jones++2013}, optical light curves taken simultaneously with
monitoring being carried out by space telescopes and/or at different
wavelengths \citep[see \eg][for a successful joint AAVSO--HST
program]{Szkody++2013}, or who are performing long baseline data mining
analysis of variable star populations.

The AAVSO, in partnership with several professional astronomers and education
specialists, successfully coordinated the NSF-funded ``Citizen Sky'' project
to monitor the 2009-2011 eclipse of the epsilon Aurigae binary star system. 
The results from this campaign \citep{Stencel2012}\footnote{The results from
the Citizen Sky project are presented in a special issue of the JAAVSO at 
\url{http://www.aavso.org/jaavso-v40n2}} were used by 
\citet{Kloppenborg++2010} to help interpret their interferometric imaging of
the obscuring disk in the system.  AAVSO observers are not only active
participants in the data collection process, but also perform original
research and publish their results, and so are involved at every level of
Citizen Science.

\CaseStudy{The Whole Earth Blazar Telescope.}
Similar in organisational spirit to the AAVSO's variable star monitoring, the
Whole Earth Blazar Telescope 
project\footnote{\url{http://www.to.astro.it/blazars/webt/}}  coordinates the
continuous monitoring of blazars at over 40 amateur and professional optical and
radio observatories, most recently in support of the Fermi and AGILE space
telescopes in the GASP long-term monitoring program. The observations taken by
this global network have been published in over 50 peer-reviewed papers since
1998. The large number of observatories involved gives the system both a fast
response time, and a large capacity for ongoing high cadence observations,
enabling blazar outbursts to be  monitored intensively for several months soon
after they are detected \citep[\eg][]{Raiteri2008}, and rapid variability to be
captured  \citep[\eg][]{Boettcher2005}.

\CaseStudy{Extragalactic Transients: Supernovae and GRBs.}
An extremely productive area of citizen astronomy has been the discovery and
early characterisation of supernovae. Since the early 1980's, 
amateur astronomers have consistently made very important contributions to the
search for nearby supernovae. For example, both Type 1B prototype objects
\citep[SN1983N and SN1984L,][]{Porter+Filippenko} were discovered by
amateur astronomer Robert Evans, who has visually identified 42 new supernovae
alone. Since 2010, amateur astronomers have
discovered  supernovae at the rate of about 150--180 per year, approximately
10\% of the total.\footnote{See e.g.\
\url{http://www.rochesterastronomy.org/sn2013/snstats.html} for a
citizen-compiled summary of recent supernova discovery statistics.}  While
professional surveys have now overtaken them in terms of total numbers of
supernovae found,  amateur astronomers continue to discover nearby and peculiar
objects in significant numbers. These citizens observe as individuals and in
teams. For example, the Puckett Observatory World Supernova 
Search,\footnote{\url{http://www.cometwatch.com/supernovasearch/discoveries.html}}
a collaboration between 26 amateur astronomers coordinated by Tim Puckett, has
found 15--20 supernovae per year, including seven of the 25 known Type 1ax class
\citep{Foley2013}. The small but dedicated worldwide community 
of amateur astronomers
searching for supernovae communicate with each other via email and their club or 
observatory websites, and report discoveries directly to the IAU via its Central
Bureau for Astronomical 
Telegrams.\footnote{\url{http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/index.html}} This is
the primary interaction between amateurs and professionals in this area: the
citizen observers are self-organised and simply provide a very valuable
discovery service: the Puckett Observatory notes that, to date, 22 peer-reviewed
publications have been written on the supernovae they have discovered.
Optical transients associated with Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) have also been
discovered by amateur astronomers who were 
able to supply the required rapid response
\citep[][]{Oksanen2008}. Again, results were reported via a telegram system, the
Gamma-ray Burst Coordinate Network\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/}} 
\citep{Monard2003,Oksanen2007}.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The example case studies in this section illustrate a thriving synergy between
amateur and professional observations, and several instances of productive
professional-amateur (``Pro-Am'') collaboration. While the solar system provides
some of the most amenable targets for amateur observation
\citep{14mousis_proam}, ``deep sky'' observations by the non-professional
community provide important further insight into the capabilities  of citizen
astronomers. In particular, we can identify three advantages held by amateur
astronomers that have enabled them to make authentic contributions to science.

The first is \textit{time availability}. Determinations of meteor frequencies or
blazar microvariability require observations on short timescales (minutes),
whereas the slow evolution of giant planets or periodic variable stars occur on
longer timescales (years and decades).  Amateur observations can be  frequent
and repetitive, but also long standing.  The second, related, advantage is that
of \textit{flexibility}: whenever a new phenomenon is discovered, citizen
observers will be keen to catch a glimpse irrespective of the scientific value
of their observations.  This reaction can be near-instantaneous, and, when made
by a networked community, provides naturally well-sampled coverage across the
globe. The third advantage is \textit{contextual}.  Professional observations
are often taken in a very different wavelength range, focus on a narrower
spatial region, or employ spectroscopic techniques that do not yield images. In
some situations, near-simultaneous wide field optical imaging by citizen
scientists provides very useful additional constraints on the process of
interest.

\CaseStudy{``Passive Observing.''}
While amateur astronomers have acquired a great deal of very useful data, the
general population is better equipped than ever to image the sky and make that
data available for scientific analysis. This has been demonstrated by two
recent professionally-led projects that made use of a largely passive
observing community connected via online social networks not usually
associated with astronomy. 

\citet{Lang++2012} used more than 2000 images scraped from the photo sharing
website Flickr as inputs to a reconstruction of the orbit of Comet Holmes.
This comet was bright enough to be visible with the naked eye during its 2007
apparition, and a large number of photographs were taken of it and uploaded.
\citeauthor{Lang++2012} were able to astrometrically calibrate many of the
images using their automatic image registration software,
\textit{astrometry.net} \citep{Lang++2010}. The calibrated images trace out
the trajectory of the comet, producing a result which is close to that
obtained from the JPL Horizons system \citep{Giorgini}. Estimates of orbital
parameters from Flickr images alone are accurate, when compared to the JPL
Horizons values, to within a few standard deviations. As the authors point
out, while in this case the photographers did not realize they were
participating in a scientific study, the potential of combining powerful
calibration software with large amounts of citizen-supplied imaging data is
made clear. This method of ``unconscious'' citizen science may prove to have
significant value in fields beyond astronomy too, if models of the statistical
sampling can be developed: for example,  ecological studies of wildlife
photographs submitted to sites like Flickr are likely to happen in the next
few years. 

Another form of passive observing occurs when dramatic impacts capture
attention. Video footage of the fireball and shockwave of the February 2013
Chelyabinsk meteor \citep{13popova} proved essential in scientifically
characterising the impactor and its likely origins, despite the fact that
these records were largely captured accidentally by autonomous security
cameras.  Trajectories reconstructed from these records even permitted the
recovery of meteorites from a debris field on the ground.  While statistics
on meteor flux and impacts are currently actively provided via a global
network of citizen scientists, sharing and publicising their observations of
meteors via the International Meteor Organisation
(IMO\footnote{\url{http://www.imo.net}}), visual observations of meteors can
also be tracked with no such active participation. By searching the archive of
short text messages submitted to the web service Twitter, Barentsen et al.
(priv.\ comm.) were able to detect several new meteor showers. Naked-eye
observers had spotted shooting stars and tweeted about them to their
followers, giving rise to a detectable signal in the stream of tweets that
night.  At present, when most  people image the night sky they don't think of
themselves contributing to science, but these projects show just how low the
barrier to entry to citizen astronomy could be.

\section{VISUAL CLASSIFICATION}
\label{sec:class}

Observing the night sky with a telescope is perhaps the most familiar of the
activities of amateur astronomers, but as the previous section showed, citizens
are also actively involved in the processing and interpretation of the data they
have taken.  In this and the next section we look at projects where much larger
archival astronomical datasets have been made available to crowds of citizens,
who are asked to inspect images and light curves, and help describe and
characterize the features in them. Despite significant advances in machine
learning and computer vision, the visual inspection of data remains an important
part of astronomy, as it continues to take advantage of the amazing human
capacity for visual pattern recognition. While many in the 1990s predicted that
the increasing size of astronomical datasets would make such time-intensive
inspection impossible, the extensive reach of the world wide web has enabled the
involvement of hundreds of thousands of citizen scientists in this form of
``crowd-sourced'' data analysis.

\subsection{Crowd-sourced Classification in Astronomy}
\label{sec:class:astro}

\CaseStudy{Stardust@home.}
While significant preliminary work had been carried out by NASA's
``clickworkers'' (see below), the project that first illustrated the potential
of crowd-sourcing for astronomical purposes was 
Stardust@home\footnote{\url{http://stardustathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/}}. The team
asked volunteers to scan through images of samples returned from Comet Wild-2 by
the \textit{Stardust} mission, attracted a large audience to the apparently
unprepossessing task of looking for dust grains in an effort to identify samples
of material from outside our Solar System. The site was built on BOSSA, an early
attempt to build a generalized platform for such crowd-sourcing projects, and
featured a stringent test which volunteers had to pass before their
classifications would be counted. Despite this hurdle, more than 20,000 people
took part, and a variety of dust grains were removed from the aerogel for
further study, contributing two of the seven candidate interstellar grains
presented in a recent Science paper \citep{Westphal}. Perhaps the most
significant long-term impact of Stardust@home, though, was the demonstration
that large amounts of volunteer effort were available even for such seemingly
uninspiring tasks such as hunting dust grains in images unlikely to be described
as intrinsically beautiful, and that, with a suitable website design and
stringent testing, scientifically valuable results could be obtained.

\CaseStudy{Galaxy morphology with Galaxy Zoo}  

The Stardust@home experience directly inspired the development of Galaxy Zoo,
perhaps the most prominent scientific crowd-sourcing project to date. Galaxy Zoo
was built on the continued importance of morphological classification of
galaxies, first introduced in a systematic fashion by Hubble, and later
developed by, among others, de~Vaucouleurs.  While the morphology of a galaxy is
closely related to its other properties, such as colour, star formation history,
dynamics, concentration and so on, it is not entirely defined by them: there is
more information in resolved images of galaxies than is captured in these
observables.  One approach was to develop simple proxies (e.g CAS \citep{Conselice}), but these
are at best approximations for true morphology. 

In an effort to prepare for large surveys, such as the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),
\citeauthor{Lahav1995}~(\citeyear{Lahav1995},\citeyear{Lahav1996}), and later,
\citet{Ball} developed neural networks trained on small samples of expert
classified images,\footnote{The Lahav papers are perhaps as interesting for
their psychology as for their astrophysics, as the classifications reveal the
relations between the senior classifiers employed to be experts.} in order to
automate the process of classification, arguing that the size of the then-upcoming
surveys left no place for visual classification.

The performance of these automatic classifiers depended on the input parameters,
including colour, magnitude and size. These variables correlate well with
morphology, but are not themselves morphological, and when included they
dominate the classification. In particular, for galaxies which do not fit the
general trends, such as spirals with dominant bulges, or star-forming
ellipticals, automated classifiers, whether using these simple measures or
more complex proxies for morphology such as texture, fail to match the
performance of expert classifiers \citep{Lin++2008}. 
As a result, \citet{Scha2007},
\citet{Nair}, and others have spent substantial amounts of time visually
classifying tens of thousands of galaxies. 

Inspired by Stardust@home, a small group led by one of the authors (Lintott) created
Galaxy Zoo in 2007 to provide basic classifications of SDSS
galaxies\footnote{The original Galaxy Zoo is preserved at
\url{http://zoo1.galaxyzoo.org} with the current incarnation at
\url{http://www.galaxyzoo.org}.} Classifiers were presented with a coloured
image centered on and scaled to one of more than 800,000 galaxies, and could
select from one of six options to characterise that object's morphology: 
clockwise, anti clockwise and edge-on spirals,
ellipticals, mergers and ``star/don't know.'' Aside from  an easily-passed
initial test, little knowledge was required or indeed presented to classifiers,
enabling them to proceed quickly to doing something real 
shortly after arriving at the
site; this approach, in contrast to Stardust@home, was
successful in encouraging large numbers of visitors to participate. 
This tactic -- in which both passing and sustained engagement provide
substantial contributions -- is illustrated in \Fref{fig:gz2} which shows results from
Galaxy Zoo 2. This later version of the project asked for more detailed
classifications via a decision tree containing questions such as `How prominent
is the bulge?', and later iterations of the project have applied a similar
approach to galaxies drawn from \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} surveys including GEMS (Rix et al. 2004),
GOODS \citep{GOODS}, COSMOS \citep{COSMOSa,COSMOSb} and 
CANDELS \citep{CANDELSa,CANDELSb}.

To date, several hundred thousand people 
have participated in the Galaxy Zoo project. However, such
figures would be meaningless if the classifications provided were not suitable
for science. With sufficient effort to ensure each galaxy is classified multiple
times (as many as 80 for many Galaxy Zoo images), these independent
classifications need to be combined into a consensus. As discussed in later
sections, this can become complex, but for Galaxy Zoo a simple weighting which
rewards consistency, first described in \citet{Land++2008}, was deemed sufficient.
Importantly, combining classifications provides not only the assignment of a
label but, in the vote fraction in a particular category, an indication of the
reliability of the classification. This allows more subtle biases, such as the
propensity for small, faint or distant galaxies to appear as elliptical
regardless of their true morphology, to be measured and accounted for
\citep[see][]{Bamford++2009}. The net result is that the Galaxy Zoo classifications
are an excellent match for results from expert classification, and have produced
science ranging from studies of red spirals \citep{Masters++2010} to investigations
of spiral spin \citep{Slosar++2009}.
A full review of Galaxy Zoo science is beyond the scope of this review; a review
of the project and many early science results can be found in
\citet{Fortson++2012}, a summary of more recent science results can be found in
\citet{Willett++2013}.


It is worth noting that some of the project's most important results
have been the result not of interaction with the main classification interface,
but represent rather serendipitous discoveries made by participants. 
We return to these in \Sref{sec:explore} below.

\CaseStudy{Surfaces of solar system bodies: Moon Zoo, Moonwatch.}
If studying galaxies remains, at least in part, a visual pursuit, then the same
is certainly true of planetary science. NASA's Clickworkers\footnote{http://www.nasaclickworkers.com/}, which asked
volunteers to identify craters on the Martian surface, lays claim to be the
oldest astronomical crowd-sourcing project. The consensus results matched those
available from experts at the time, but failed to go beyond this promising start
to produce results of real scientific value. More recently, interfaces inviting
classifiers to look at the Moon, Mercury, Mars and Vesta have been launched and
attracted significant numbers of classifications; however, although preliminary
results have been promising \citep{Kanefsky}, these projects have yet to produce datasets that
have been used by the planetary science community in the same way that Galaxy
Zoo has by the astronomical community. The recent release of the first paper from the Cosmoquest
Moon Mappers project \citep{Robbins} may indicate that this will change. 



\CaseStudy{Tracking Features in Giant Planet Atmospheres: WinJUPOS}
Not all astronomical crowd-sourced visual classification is led by 
professional scientists.
JUPOS\footnote{\url{http://jupos.privat.t-online.de}} is an amateur astronomy
project involving a global network of citizen observers to monitor the
appearance of planetary atmospheres.  Recent software developments have provided
a much more quantitative perspective on these citizen observations. The WinJUPOS
software was developed by a team
of citizen scientists led by G.~Hahn; it allows multiple images of a giant
planet to be stacked with a correction for the rapid rotation of Jupiter or
Saturn  (once every 10 hours), then re-projected onto a latitude-longitude
coordinate system, so that the precise positional details of atmospheric
features can be determined via ``point-and-click,'' relying on the citizen's
ability to identify features on the planetary disc visually.  

By doing this over many nights surrounding Jupiter's opposition, the community
builds up enormous drift charts, comprising tens of thousands of positional
measurements for these features, ranging from the tiniest convective structure
being moved by the jet streams, to the largest vortices
\citep[e.g.][]{WinJUPOSRedSpot}.  The charts reveal the dynamic interactions
within the jovian weather layer, and the long-term stability of their zonal jets
(see e.g., the regular bulletins provided by the Jupiter section of the British
Astronomical Association). The positions can be extrapolated forward in time,
enabling targeted observations by professional observatories or even visiting
spacecraft. The Juno mission, scheduled to arrive at Jupiter in 2016, is reliant
on the citizen observer community to provide this sort of contextual mapping for
the close-in observations from the orbiter.  This long-term record of Jupiter's
visible appearance by citizen scientists has proven to be an  invaluable
resource for the giant planet community.

\CaseStudy{Time domain astronomy: Supernova Zoo and Planet Hunters}  
\label{SNZoo} 
The three defining characteristics of ``Big Data'' have come to be accepted as
volume, velocity and variety.  Time-domain astronomy projects, that indeed
require the immediate inspection of challenging volumes of live, high velocity,
complex data, can benefit from citizen science, as shown by two recent projects,
Supernova Zoo and Planet Hunters.   While transients such as supernovae or
asteroids can often be found through the use of automatic routines, visual
inspection is still used by many professional science teams as part of their
process of selecting candidates for follow-up. 

The most successful attempt to use crowd-sourcing to attack these problems to
date has been the offshoot of Galaxy Zoo described in \citet{SmithSN}.  Data
from the Palomar Transient Factory \citep{LawPTF} was automatically processed
and images of candidate supernovae uploaded on a nightly basis; this triggered
an email to volunteers who, upon responding, were shown the new image, a
reference image and the difference between the two. By analyzing the answers
given by the volunteers to a series of questions, candidates were sorted into 
three categories, roughly corresponding to ``probable supernova,'' ``likely
astrophysical but non-supernova transient'' and ``artifact.'' The results were
displayed on a webpage and used by the science team to select targets for
follow-up. Despite the Supernova Zoo site attracting many fewer classifiers 
than Galaxy Zoo, it was highly effective in sorting through data,  with
consensus typically reached on all images within 15 minutes of the initial email
being sent. 

The large dataset generated by this project was used by \citet{Brink} to develop
a supervised learning approach to automatic classification for PTF transients.
The performance of this routine, which for a false-positive rate of 1\% is more
than 90\% complete, depends on the kind of large training set that can be
generated by crowds of inspectors; this suggests a future path for large surveys
in which citizen science provides initial, training data and is followed by
machines taking on the remaining bulk of the work. Encouragingly,
\citeauthor{Brink}'s method, which makes use of a set of 42 features extracted
from survey images, has performance which is insensitive to a small fraction of
mislabeled training data, suggesting that the requirements for accuracy of
citizen science projects which aim to calibrate later machine learning may be
less stringent than otherwise thought. 

A different approach to crowd-sourced classification in time-domain astronomy is
exemplified by the Planet Hunters
project,\footnote{\url{http://planethunters.org}} 
which asks volunteers to examine
light curves drawn from the dataset provided by the \Kepler mission in
order to identify interesting events in retrospect. While the task of
identifying transits from extrasolar planets is, at first glance, one which
seems more suited for automated than for human analysis, the success of Planet
Hunters in identifying more than fifty planet candidates missed by the automatic
routines suggests that there remains a role for inspection by eye in cases where
the relevant science requires samples of high completeness. Several of the
planets found by Planet Hunters are unusual: PH1b, the project's first confirmed
planet \citep{Schwamb++2013} and a circumbinary, is the first planet known in a
four-star system. 
Others, including the more than forty candidates identified 
by \citep{Wang2013,Schmitt2014}, might have been
expected to be recovered by more conventional searches. Planet Hunters,
therefore, is acting as an independent test of the \Kepler pipeline's efficiency
\citep{Schwamb++2012} and has inspired improvements in subsequent analysis
\citep{Batalha++2013}. A recent redesign of the project, launched in September 2014, aims to provide a 'first-look' 
at data from the Kepler extended mission, emphasising rapid analysis through a 
system which quickly identifies potential transits and then asks experienced volunteers
to review them.

\CaseStudy{Using existing tools: Near Earth Asteroid precovery and RAD@home.} 
Online visual classification does not necessarily require a custom-built
interface. \citet{Solano2014} describe an online classification project carried
out by the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) to refine the orbits of Near Earth
Astroids (NEAs) using archival images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Over
3000 volunteers inspected pairs of images looking for and marking moving
objects, leading to the improvement of 6\% of known NEAs. While designed and
funded as an outreach project, the SVO made use of the
\textit{Aladin}\footnote{\url{http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr}} VO science user
interface tool in use by professional astronomers, and enabled the submission of
results via the Minor Planet Circular system. 

Citizen  scientists utilising publically-available video data from
observatories such as SOHO and STEREO and their choice of graphics software
have  been able to discover numerous sungrazing comets (\Sref{sec:obs}).
Indeed, the majority of  2000+ SOHO sungrazer discoveries have been due to
dedicated amateurs over  15+ years of operation, e.g.,][]{12battams},
reporting their observations to professional  observers via the Sungrazer
Project\footnote{\url{http://sungrazer.nrl.navy.mil/}}.  

Similar in spirit to these projects is the RAD@Home project \citep{Hota2014},
a ``a zero-funded, zero-infrastructure, human-resource network'' using free
web services and public astronomical data archives to organise and enable
citizen astronomy research. The community of volunteers was formed around a
Facebook group,\footnote{\url{https://www.facebook.com/groups/RADathome}} and
its initial investigations have focused on morphological identification of
massive spiral galaxies hosting  radio~loud AGN \citep{Hota2011} in the GMRT
TGSS survey imaging.  Some of the RAD@home volunteers have co-authored
follow-up proposals, mentored by the project's PI. We return to the enabling
of volunteers to ``graduate'' to more advanced activites in
Sections~\ref{sec:model} and~\ref{sec:explore} below.

\subsection{Classification Analysis}
\label{sec:class:analysis}

In most visual classification projects, working on archived image data with
little time pressure, the random assignment of task to classifier, followed by
simple, democratic treatment of the classifications has been judged
sufficient. However, the need for rapid processing of images in time domain
astronomy projects has prompted the investigation of more efficient analyses
of the classification data.  Using the Supernova Zoo project's archive as a
test, \citet{Simpson++2012IBCC} developed a Bayesian method, IBCC, for
assessing classifier performance; in this view, each classification provides
information both about the subject of the classification and about the
classifier themselves. Classifier performance given subject properties can
thus be predicted and an optimum set of task assignments calculated. 
Moreover, work by Simpson et al., as well as \citet{Kamar} and
\citet{Waterhouse} on Galaxy Zoo data, suggests that accuracy can be
maintained with as few as 30\% of classifications.  This sort of optimization
will be increasingly important for online citizen science, especially in
projects that use a live stream of data, rather than an archive, since the
classification analysis will need to be done in real time.

\CaseStudy{Rare event detection: Space Warps} 
Steps towards real-time classification analysis have been taken in the Space
Warps project.\footnote{\url{http://spacewarps.org}} 
Space Warps is a rare object search: volunteers are shown deep
sky survey images and asked to mark features that look as though they are
gravitationally lensed galaxies or quasars (Marshall et al, More et al in prep.).
Extensive training is
provided via an ongoing tutorial that includes simulated lenses and known
non-lenses, and immediate pop-up feedback as to whether these training images
were correctly classified. Because real lenses are rare (appearing once every
$10^{2-4}$ images, depending on the dataset), the primary goal is to reject the
multitude of uninteresting images so that new ones can be inspected -- and this
drives the need for efficiency. Marshall et al (in prep.) derived a
simplified version of the IBCC classification analysis that updates a
probablistic model of both the subjects and the agents that represent the
classifiers in a statistically online manner (enabling, in principle, real-time
analysis). This
analysis was run daily during each of the Space Warps projects, and subjects
retired from the stream as they crossed a low probability threshold. This
algorithm is being implemented into the web application itself for future
datasets. 

The increased  efficiency of visual classification projects that will come with
real-time analysis will enable feedback on the projects' progress to be given
much more promptly -- an important part of the collaboration between
professionals and amateurs in crowd-sourcing projects.

\subsection{Visual Classification in Other Fields}
\label{sec:class:non-astro}

Although, as described in the previous section, astronomical analysis led the
development of citizen science as a data analysis tool, it has quickly been
adopted by other fields. In some cases, this adoption has been explicit. The
tools developed for Stardust@home were developed into a general purpose
library for citizen science, BOSSA. Both this and the Zooniverse platform
(which hosts many of the examples described above) support projects from
fields as diverse as ecology and papyrology. This diversity allows general
lessons about project design to be drawn; indeed, this is an active area of
research for academic fields as diverse as computer science, economics and
social science. A recent paper by \citet{Crowston}, for example, compares
Planet Hunters and Seafloor Explorer,  a Zooniverse project which explores the
health of fisheries off the coast of North America, finding in both cases that
volunteers who are new to the project seek out ``practice proxies'' --
examples of apparently correct behaviour from amongst material accumulated in
the informal social spaces that accompany the main project.

Projects from other fields can also suggest strategies which could be adopted
by future citizen astronomy projects. For example, future projects involving
analysis of survey data which has been collected for a multitude of purposes
may require a more sophisticated model for data analysis than the simple
decision tree presented by projects such as Galaxy Zoo.

\CaseStudy{Snapshot Serengeti}  
This project invites the visual classification of animals in
photographs from more than two hundred motion-sensitive ``camera traps''
installed in the Serengeti National Park, and enables a particularly
sophisticated volunteer response. Driven in part by the need for an interface
which allows volunteers to state the obvious (for example, identifying
elephants, lions or zebras) and also to provide more obscure classification (for
example, distinguishing between different species of gazelle),  a variety of
classification paths are presented. In addition to just clicking buttons
identifying species, volunteers can opt for a decision tree-like approach, or
choose from a variety of similar species (``Looks like an antelope...'') or
search the descriptions provided in order to make an informed  classification
(``Show me all animals whose descriptions involve `ears' ''). This hybrid model
has proved successful not only in encouraging classification, but also in
encouraging learning; over a Snapshot Serengeti classifier's ``career'' they are
increasingly likely to chose more direct routes.

\CaseStudy{Visual inspection of 3-D biological scans: Eyewire}  
Another aspect of project strategy, and design, relates to the engagement of
the volunteers. The online citizen astronomy projects developed so far have
tended to emphasise co-operation between volunteers, and the results being due
to a team effort. Elsewhere, experiments with a more competitive approach to
citizen science, ``gamifying'' the activity, have been performed. The Eyewire
project\footnote{\url{http://www.eyewire.org}}, based at MIT, seeks to
supplement machine learning identification of neurons in three-dimensional
scans. Notably, this project incorporated some ``gamified'' elements into its
design. Participants in the project, who are asked to identify connected
regions throughout a three-dimensional scan, earn points based on
participation and also have a separate, publicly visible, accuracy score.  In
addition to overall leader boards, the project also runs short challenges
including a regular Friday ``happy hour'' in which participants compete on
specific problems. Eyewire is also notable for its other strong community
elements, with a chat room open and available to all participants in the
project (supplemented, incidentally, by a ``bot'' built by a participant which
answers frequently asked questions from new users). Its first result, which
drew on mapping of so-called `starburst' neurons, was  published in mid-2014
\citep{KimEyewire}.

\section{DATA MODELLING}
\label{sec:model}

New understanding of the world comes from the interpretation -- fitting -- of
data with a physical model. Such ``data modelling'' often involves technical
difficulties that computers may find hard to overcome, associated with complex
and/or computationally expensive likelihood functions. Humans, by applying their
developed intuition, can contribute a great deal to the exploration of a model's
parameter space by closing in quickly on those configurations that fit the data
well. This process can be particularly satisfying, rather like solving a puzzle.
Meanwhile, many ``machine learning'' techniques effective in one field can often
be adapted to astronomical problems: there are plenty of citizens with the
skills to do this. How have citizen scientists been involved in model making and
data fitting in astronomy, and other fields, to date?

\CaseStudy{The Milky Way Project (MWP\footnote{http://milkywayproject.org}).}
\citet{Simpson++2012MWP} provided volunteers with a fairly flexible set of
annulus-drawing tools, for annotating circularly-symmetric ``bubble'' features
in colour-composite (24.0, 8.0 and  4.5$\mu$m) infrared images from surveys
carried out by the Spitzer space telescope (\Fref{fig:modeling}). 
These bubbles are hypothesized  to
have been caused by recently-formed high mass stars at the centre each. The
(bubble) model in this case is simple and recognizable, making both the
interface construction and its operation relatively straightforward. The large
sample of  bubble models have been used to investigate the possibility of
further star formation being triggered at the bubble surfaces
\citep{KendrewEtal2012}. A subsequent effort \citep{Beaumont} used data provided
by the project to train a machine learning algorithm, \textit{Brut}, in bubble
finding. \textit{Brut} is able to identify a small number of sources  which were
not identified in the \citeauthor{Simpson++2012MWP} catalog. These bubbles were
difficult for humans to identify,  owing to their lying close to bright sources,
and so having low contrast relative to their surroundings.

In addition, \textit{Brut} has proved effective at identifying suspect bubbles
included in the previous (pre-citizen) surveys. Given the relatively small size
of the MWP sample, the main use of machine learning here has been to provide an
independent check on the citizen classification data; for larger samples, as
discussed below, an approach in which machine learning is trained on citizen
science data, and gradually takes over the classification task could be
considered.

\CaseStudy{Modelling Lens Candidates} 
The Space Warps project (\Sref{sec:class:analysis}) has an informal data
modeling element. The classification interface is restricted to enabling
identification of candidate gravitationally-lensed features, but all the images
are available via the project's discussion forum. A small team of volunteers
(including several citizens who helped design the project) has engaged in
modeling some of the identified lens candidates using web-based software
developed and supported by the project science
team.\footnote{\url{http://mite.physik.uzh.ch}} Results from a small test
program show that the Einstein radii (proportional to the lens galaxy masses) 
derived by the  ensemble of citizens are
as accurate as those derived by experts 
(Kueng et al, in prep.).
A pilot collaborative modeling analysis was carried out and written up by a
small group of Space Warps volunteers\footnote{See
\url{http://talk.spacewarps.org/\#/boards/BSW0000006/discussions/DSW00008fr} for
the forum thread that was used.} \citep{Wilcox2014}.

\CaseStudy{Galaxy Zoo: Mergers} 
This has been perhaps the most advanced attempt at data modeling in 
astronomical web-based citizen science \citep{HolincheckEtal2010,WallinEtal2010}.
Here, simple N-body simulations of galaxy mergers were performed in a Java
applet, and the results selected according to visual similarity to images of
galaxy mergers (previously identified in the Galaxy Zoo project). A key
hypothesis here is that the inspectors of the simulation outputs would be able
to find matches to the data more readily than a computer could, for two reasons.
First is that humans are good at {\it vague} pattern matching: they do not get
distracted by detailed pixel value comparisons but instead have an intuitive
understanding of when one object is ``like'' another. The second is that
initializing a galaxy merger simulation requires a large number of parameters to
be set -- and it's this high dimensionality  that makes the space of possible
models hard to explore for a machine. Humans should be able to navigate the
space using their intuition, which is partly physical and partly learned from
experience gained from playing with the system. Initial tests on the merging
system Arp 86 showed
the crowd converging on a single location in parameter space, and that the
simulated mergers at this location do indeed strongly resemble the Arp~86
system. The authors have since collected thousands of citizen-generated models
for a sample of a large number SDSS merging systems (Holincheck et al, in
preparation, \Fref{fig:modeling}).

\CaseStudy{Protein Modeling with Foldit}  
One of the most successful examples of crowd-sourced, ``manual'' data modeling is the
online multi-player 3-D protein modeling game,  Foldit
\citep{Cooper++2010}\footnote{\url{http://fold.it}} In this pioneering
project, players compete in teams to find the best -- that is, the lowest free energy --
molecular structures for particular protein ``puzzles.'' 
These puzzles are naturally visualizable in three dimensions, but 
they nevertheless involve thousands of degrees of freedom, in a parameter
space that is notoriously hard to explore.
Under the hood is the
professional Rosetta structure prediction methodology; the player's scores are
simply the negative of the Rosetta-computed energy. Foldit provides an
accessible interface to the Rosetta toolkit, which provides multiple ways to
interact with the protein structure as the global minimum energy solution is
sought. The Rosetta model parameter free energy hyper-surface is completely analogous
to the complex likelihood surface of any non-linear model, the kind of model
that is to be found in planetary system dynamics, gravitational lenses,
merging galaxies, and many other astrophysical data analysis situations. 

Results from Foldit have been very encouraging, with the players discovering
several new protein configurations, leading to improved enzyme performance 
\citep{Eiben++2012} and new understanding of retroviral drug design
\citep{Khatib++2011a}. The team have suggested several features of Foldit that
appear to them to have underpinned its success. Recipes for manipulating the
protein structures (that codify strategies) can be shared within teams, and
later made available by the Foldit team to the whole community -- these
algorithms evolve rapidly as different players modify them, and can rival (if
not out-perform) strategies developed by professional scientists 
\citep{Khatib++2011b}. The game provides multiple sources of motivation
(competition between players, collaboration within a team, short term scores,
long term status) which appeal to a variety of players.

\CaseStudy{Online Data Challenges}
We now turn to data modeling by citizens implementing machine learning
techniques in astronomy, via analysis challenges organised by members of the
professional astrophysics community. The measurement of weak gravitational
lensing by large scale structure (``cosmic shear'') relies on the measurement of
the shapes of distant, faint galaxies with extreme accuracy. 
Blind galaxy shape
estimation challenges have had an enormous impact on the field, revealing biases
present in existing techniques, and providing a way for researchers outside the
world of professional cosmology to participate. In particular, the GREAT08
challenge \citep{BridleEtal2010} saw very successful entries from two (out of a total of 11) teams of
researchers from outside of astronomy (albeit still professional researchers),
including the winner. A companion, somewhat streamlined galaxy shape measurement
challenge, ``Mapping Dark Matter,'' was hosted at the Kaggle
website\footnote{\url{http://www.kaggle.com/c/mdm}} \citep{KitchingEtal2012}.
The wider reach of this platform led to over 70 teams making over 700 entries to
the competition; many of the teams did not contain professional astronomers,
although most were still from academia.

In a comparison with the GREAT challenges, the \citeauthor{KitchingEtal2012}
found a factor of several improvement in shear accuracy over comparable previous
challenges, and suggested two interesting explanations for this success. First,
the challenge was designed to be as accessible as possible, with an extensive
training set of data that needed very little explanation; in this way the
challenge was geared towards {\it idea generation}. Second, they noted that the
competitive  nature of the challenge (a webpage leaderboard was updated in real
time as entries were submitted) seemed to stimulate the analysts into improving
their submissions. Kaggle offers cash prizes, which will have had some effect as
well (the pot was \$3000 for this challenge, even if indirectly).

Two more astronomical Kaggle challenges have since been set. The first involved
inferring the positions of dark matter halos based on their weak lensing effects
\citep{Harvey++2014}\footnote{\url{http://www.kaggle.com/c/DarkWorlds}}  This
challenge attracted the attention of 357 teams, perhaps due to its larger
prizes, and led to an improvement in halo position accuracy of 30\%.  It also
sparked some debate in its forums as to the design of the challenge: the models
used to generate the data, the size of the test datasets (and consequent
stability of the leaderboard),  the choice of leaderboard metric and so on.
These issues are also of generic importance for scientists looking to
crowd-source algorithm development.   It is interesting to note that the Kaggle
forums are a useful resource for the Kaggle development team: the citizens who
are active there do influence the design of the site infrastructure and
challenge rules (D.~Harvey, priv.~comm.). 

The most recent Kaggle astronomy challenge was to reproduce the Galaxy~Zoo~2
crowd-sourced galaxy morphologies based on automated measurements of the SDSS
color composite JPEG
images.\footnote{\url{http://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge}}
329~teams entered the challenge, including professional astronomers, academics
specializing in non-astronomy areas, teams from university courses,  and members
of the public (K. Willett, priv.\ comm.).  The top performing algorithms were
able to reproduce detailed morphologies, including features on scales of only a
few pixels and those with highly non-symmetric geometries, that were originally
generated by crowd-sourced annotations (Willett et al., in prep.). All of the
leading entries also used various implementations of convolutional neural
networks (convnets); the results suggest that convnets offer one of the best
candidates for automated machine learning trained on gold standard data in
larger, future surveys (see \Sref{sec:future_csvis}). 

Like Foldit's ``recipes,'' the Kaggle challenges are crowd-sourcing the
development of new algorithms. As data science plays an increasingly important
role in industry and commerce, we might expect the number of citizens
interested in applying their skills to science problems in their spare time to
grow. The challenge is to present those problems in meaningful ways, to enable
high value contributions to be made. While members of this community may not
identify as ``citizen astronomers,'' there is clearly an opportunity for
citizen data scientists to play an important support role.

\section{CITIZEN-LED ENQUIRY}
\label{sec:explore}

The previous sections have focused on specific, and somewhat  isolated
activities in which citizens have participated. In most cases, the community's
involvement has been a {\it contribution} to a scientific investigation defined
by professionals. The most important part of any scientific investigation is the
question at its heart: what is it we are trying to find out about the universe?
In this section we look at some cases where the process of enquiry, the science
itself, has been led by citizens. While citizen scientists have published as
first authors in research journals \citep[see e.g.]{Hui2013,Liang2014},  this is
still a fairly rare occurrence. Instead, we focus on some collaborative projects
where the asking of science questions by citizens is supported and guided by
professionals.

In principle, this is an area of great potential. The constraints of funding
proposals and management of research groups can often mean that professional
scientists focus very narrowly on particular topics of research, specializing in
particular techniques or datasets.  Steering away from this course implies
taking risks with time management, and allocation of resources to an ultimately
fruitless research area can be detrimental to careers.  Citizen scientists are
largely free of these managerial and budgetary constraints, and are able to
devote their attentions to whatever topics interest them. Moreover, we might
expect outsiders to ask some unusual questions, and make connections and
suggestions that highly focused professionals may not have thought of.

\CaseStudy{The Galaxy Zoo Forum.} 

The best known serendipitous discovery emerging from the Galaxy Zoo project is
``Hanny's Voorwerp'' \citep{Lintott++2009}, a galaxy-scale light echo which
reveals a recent ($\sim100,000$ years ago)  shutdown of AGN activity in IC~2497, 
a neighboring spiral galaxy \citep{Keel++2012}. 
The discovery of the Voorwerp was first
recorded in the Galaxy Zoo forum a few weeks after the project started, and
inspired a more systematic search for similar phenomena in other galaxies. This
project, made possible by the deep engagement in the forum community of Galaxy
Zoo science team member Bill Keel, succeeded in finding more than forty
instances of clouds which appear to have been ionized by AGN activity. 
One-third of such systems show signs of similar significant drops in AGN activity on
timescales of tens of thousands of years \citep{KeelAGN}.

The ability of the Zoo volunteers to carry out their own research, moving far
beyond the mere ``clockwork'' required by the main interface, is best
illustrated by the discovery of the Galaxy Zoo Green Peas
\citep{Cardamone++2009}. These small, round and, in SDSS imaging, green,
systems are dwarf galaxies with specific star formation rates which are
unprecedented in the local Universe, matched only by high-redshift Lyman-break
galaxies. Volunteers not only identified these systems, but organized a
systematic search and further review of them. This effort included the use of
tools designed by SDSS for professional astronomers to acquire and study
spectroscopic data. Other projects, such as the systematic search for
overlapping galaxies \citep{Keeloverlaps} in order to study the dust
distribution and attenuation law \citep{Keelatten}, were initially directed by
professional members of the Galaxy Zoo team but thenceforth drew on the 
enthusiasm and ability of volunteers. 

While the discovery of the Peas and other similar projects demonstrates the
exploration ability of the Galaxy Zoo citizen community, it is important to
note that the simpler, initial interaction provided by the main classification
interface was necessary in order to develop that community in the first place.
The participants in the citizen scientists' investigation of the Peas did not
arrive on the site wanting to dig into spectra or confident of their ability
to do so; these were the results of their participation. The project acted as
an ``engine of motivation'' in inspiring its participants to become more
involved.

\CaseStudy{Lightcurve analysis on Planet Hunters \Talk.}  

The data modelling examples of \Sref{sec:model} all involved modeling
infrastructure provided by either the project's developers or their science
teams. Planet Hunters provides a case where citizens have carried out their own
modeling analysis, using their own tools. Critical to this endeavour was the
ability of a small,  and increasingly expert, group of volunteers to identify
objects worthy of further analysis. For Galaxy Zoo, the forum had served this
purpose but, as the project matured, participation in discussions became
restricted to a small and decreasing fraction of the community. Planet Hunters
was the first Zooniverse project to introduce an integrated discussion tool,
known as \Talk. Classifiers were asked, after viewing each light curve,
whether they wanted to discuss what they had seen; more advanced users could
then harvest interesting candidates from these posts. For example, the
candidates presented in \citet{LintottPH} were initially collated by volunteers.

Their involvement was not limited to collecting Planet Hunters candidates.
Making use of the \Kepler archive, these advanced users were able to investigate
the full set of data for candidate stars, producing periodograms and making
fits  to transits to derive planet candidate properties. Some of this analysis,
for example checking the \Kepler field for  background sources, can be carried
out online with tools originally intended for professional astronomers, but much
was done offline using Excel or other software.\footnote{The expense of IDL
licenses was a major barrier to further modelling; much of the software used
by the \Kepler team is written in this proprietary language.} 
PH1b (\Sref{sec:class:astro}) was one of the systems discovered in this way, as indeed 
were the candidates in the \citet{Wang2013} and \citet{Schmitt2014} papers.
Nor was this sort of work
restricted to planet candidates; interesting variable stars, including several
new RR Lyrae systems, and cataclysmic variables \citep[e.g.\ ][]{KatoOsaki} 
have been discovered and analysed by Planet Hunters volunteers. This pattern of work, in
which more experienced or specialised volunteers follow up on serendipitous discoveries
identified initially by classifiers working in the main interface, is explicitly encouraged in the
new version of Planet Hunters, when comments can be made on light-curves without leaving the main
interface.

\CaseStudy{Galaxy Zoo: Quench.} 
Examples such as those above show that advanced work is possible within
distributed citizen science projects, but that this requires volunteers to take
on such tasks themselves. In order to increase the number, and perhaps the
diversity, of volunteers moving beyond simple classification, experiments have
been conducted to provide more scaffolded experiences. One of the most ambitious
was the Galaxy Zoo: Quench project\footnote{\url{http://quench.galaxyzoo.org}}
(Trouille et al. in prep.) which offered volunteers the opportunity to
``experience science from beginning to end.''

In this project, classification of a sample of potential post-merger galaxies
selected from the main Galaxy Zoo sample was followed by open exploration of
both the classification data and the metadata for these galaxies (available from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) by the volunteers, enabled by a
``dashboard.\footnote{\url{http://tools.zooniverse.org/\#/dashboards/galaxy\_zoo}}''
3298 users participated in the classification stage, and  around 25\% of
those Zooniverse-registered users who did so took part in data analysis. These results
contributed to a discussion from which a set of astrophysically
interesting conclusions were formulated by a small number of participants (~10),
with support from the project science team.

Galaxy Zoo: Quench demonstrated that a hierarchical approach, with simple
tasks leading to more advanced analysis, can be successful in encouraging
large numbers of volunteers to move beyond simple classification; the number
working with the data was much higher as a percentage of participants than in
Planet Hunters, a project with success in volunteer user engagement.  However,
engagement with the literature (either by reading or writing) required close
collaboration with the professionals involved. One interesting feature of the
Quench project was its teething problems: issues with the data were discovered
by the citizens, and needed to be fixed. (Similar problems have been
encountered in Kaggle challenges.) While this caused the project to slow down
and lose engagement somewhat, it does illustrate a key feature of citizen-led
enquiry, namely that the same book-keeping, cleaning and calibration problems
will arise in these projects just as they do in professional ones, and the
limiting factor may well be the  amount of professional effort available. The
challenge is to enable the crowd to solve them quickly and keep investigating.

\section{UNDERSTANDING THE CITIZENS}
\label{sec:crowd}

Having surveyed some of the activities involving citizen scientists, we can
now consider some questions about this community itself. Who participates in
citizen science, and what motivates them?


% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

\subsection{Demographics}
\label{sec:crowd:demographics}

Who is participating in citizen astronomy? We might expect the demographics to
vary with activity, and with the level of commitment required. We have some
understanding of at least the former division from two studies that were
carried out approximately simultaneously, one of the community  participating
in Galaxy Zoo, and another of the American Association of Variable Star
Observers (AAVSO).  \citet{Rad++2013} surveyed the Galaxy Zoo volunteer
community to investigate their motivations (\Sref{sec:crowd:motivation}
below), via a voluntary online questionnaire. The 11,000 self-selected Galaxy
Zoo users identified as 80\% male, with both genders having an approximately
uniform distribution in age between their mid-twenties and late fifties.
(Responses from volunteers under 18 were removed). The
authors point out that this is close to the US internet user age distribution,
except for slight but significant excesses in numbers of post-50s males,
post-retirement people of both genders, and a deficit in males under 30. The
survey respondents  also tended to be more highly educated than average US
internet users, with most holding at least an undergraduate degree, and around
a quarter having a masters or doctorate. Very similar findings were reported
by \citet{COSMOQUESTsurvey} from a survey of COSMOQUEST project participants.

These findings can be compared with a survey of the members of AAVSO:
\citet{P+P2012} received over 600 responses (corresponding to about a quarter
of the society's members). The education levels of
the AAVSO repondents matches the Galaxy Zoo community very closely; the AAVSO
age distribution is more peaked (in the mid fifties), with a similar post-60
decline but also a marked absence of younger people. The online nature of the
Galaxy Zoo project seems to have increased the participation of younger (pre
middle-age) people. Likewise, the Galaxy Zoo gender bias, while itself
extreme, is less so than at AAVSO, where some 92\% of survey respondents were
male. One additional piece of information provided by the AAVSO survey is the
profession of the variable star observers: most (nearly 60\%) of the survey
respondents were found to be working in science, computer science, engineering
and education. 

The Galaxy Zoo and AAVSO communities differ by more than just the nature of
their activity. The smaller AAVSO community is arguably more engaged in its
research, in the sense that a larger fraction of its membership is active in
taking observations and contributing to analyses. It would be very interesting
to know how citizen scientist motivation varied with the level of
participation: dividing the Galaxy Zoo community into volunteers that
contribute to the forum and those who do not could be interesting; perhaps
more so would be to repeat the analysis of \citeauthor{Rad++2013} over a wide
range of projects, and look for trends there. The emergent picture thus far,
however, is of a well-educated (and often scientifically trained)  but
male-dominated citizen science community, whose female and younger membership
is likely to have been, at least in part, enabled via projects being hosted
online. Continuing to lower the barriers to entry for currently
under-represented demographic groups would seem both important, and within
reach.


% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:crowd:motivation}

What motivates citizen scientists? The two demographic studies referred to above
also covered this question; having previously \citep{Rad++2010} identified 12
categories of motivation in an earlier pilot study, \citet{Rad++2013} asked the
170,000 Galaxy Zoo volunteers at the time to comment on how motivated they were
by each of these categories, and which was their primary motivation. The 6\% who
responded gave consistent answers to those given by around 900 forum users who
responded in a separate appeal, allowing conclusions about this presumably more
engaged sub-population to be drawn. A desire to {\it contribute} to science was
found to be the dominant primary motivation, being selected by 40\% of
respondents. {\it Astronomy}, {\it science}, {\it vastness}, {\it beauty} and 
{\it discovery} were all motivation categories that were found to very important
to the volunteers, while {\it fun}, {\it learning} and {\it community} were less
important. 

The AAVSO demographic survey \citep{P+P2012} found similar results: over a third
of variable star observers cited {\it involvement in science and research} as
their primary source of motivation. However, a similar number gave an {\it
interest in variable stars} as theirs, perhaps reflecting a stronger focus on
the science questions involved than is present in the Galaxy Zoo community. Both
groups of citizen scientists are clearly quite serious in their reasons for
taking part: their motivations are actually very close to those of professional
scientists, as many readers of this review will recognize. Perhaps surprisingly,
the participants in online data analysis citizen science projects seem to a
large extent to be a distinct community from those who participate in more
traditional amateur astronomical activities. Galaxy Zoo classifiers, for
example, are not, for the most part, regular amateur observers. 

While research on the skill, and conceptual understanding, that  people aquire
while participating in citizen science activities is still in its early stages,
there are some hints that continued engagement is correlated with both
performance in the task at hand, and understanding of the physics and astronomy
underlying the task. \citet{Prather++2013} offered Galaxy Zoo and Moon Zoo
volunteers the opportunity to take questionnaires that tested their
understanding of the astrophysics associated with each project, and found that
performance on this questionnaire correlated with high levels of participation
in the projects. In a quantitative analysis of ten of the Zooniverse projects,
\citet{LR2014} detected significant shifts towards more advanced vocabulary used
on the discussion boards over the lifetime of each project. In the Space Warps
project, the probabilistic model for the crowd includes a measure of each
classifier's skill; a strong correlation is seen between a classifier's skill,
and the number of images they have seen (Marshall et al, in prep.). It seems as
though the skillful classifiers remain engaged in the project for a long time,
while almost no long-term participants have low skill -- an observation
consistent with the volunteers being motivated by contributing to science.
Interestingly, \citet{LR2014} found a strong correlation between the number of
classifications performed, and the number of contributions to the comment or
discussion boards, with two thirds of the latter being contributed by 1\% of the
volunteers showing above average engagement. Community interaction seems to be
particularly important for dedicated volunteers, even if it may not be what they
would give as their primary motivation.

\subsection{Competition or Collaboration?}
\label{sec:crowd:gamification}

As seen in \Sref{sec:class:non-astro} and \Sref{sec:model}  above,
non-astronomical projects may have much to teach us about ``gamification'' as
a motivator -- the inclusion, either explicitly or implicitly, of game-like
mechanics such as scores, ``badges'' or other rewards, leaderboards, and so
on. The Foldit team presents a strong case for games as drivers of activity in
citizen science, and the Kaggle challenges depend on competition to stimulate
engagement. However, an early experiment with Galaxy Zoo showed that the
addition of a score de-incentivised poor classifiers, but also resulted in the
best classifiers leaving, presumably having been satisfied once a top score
was achieved. A recent study by \citet{Eveleigh++2013} of the Zooniverse's Old
Weather project, which included basic rankings for classifiers, also
highlighted these dangers, identifying volunteers who were alienated by the
addition of this game-like score. They felt discouraged when top scores could
not be matched, and worried about data quality if the scoring scheme rewarded
quantity of classifications rather than accuracy. Taking seriously the finding
that citizen scientists are motivated by a perception of authentic
participation in research, it seems right to be cautious about introducing
elements which are, or which are perceived to be, in tension with this primary
motivation. 

Moreover, the introduction of a significant incentivizing scheme relies on an
accurate model of what ``correct'' behaviour would look like. This may prove
to be a significant barrier to accuracy if such a model is not available. For
example, in Planet Hunters, such a model would not have included unusual
systems such as PH1b. Where a strong incentive scheme results in near-uniform
classifier behaviour, a loss of flexibility in later data analysis could be
incurred.  A strong comparison of the type of reward structure utilized by
Eyewire and the approach used by projects such as Galaxy Zoo is needed, in
order to inform future project design. 

The surveys described in the previous section reveal a community of people
many of whom may have left academic science behind as soon as they finished
their education, but whose passion for astronomy and the desire to be part of
the scientific process drives them to actively observe the night sky or to
participate in the analysis of large datasets.  While ``community'' was not
found to be a strong stated motivator for the Galaxy Zoo volunteers, it is
nevertheless very important for those who participate in the discussions. For
these more engaged volunteers, being part of a community (albeit a distributed
one) seems to bring great enjoyment and satisfaction, as they unite under this
shared interest which may be far removed from their ``normal''  lives. 

The binding together of these community  is reflected in the language they
use: Zooniverse volunteers refer to themselves as ``Zooites,''  for example. 
It is interesting to note that \textit{approachable} project names are almost 
universal in citizen science, and perhaps function as ice-breakers in their
nascent communities. Through improved forum design, more recent Zooniverse
projects have sought to further widen participation in community discussion,
hypothesizing not that it will more strongly motivate people, but because it
will help them make better contributions. Tests of hypotheses like this should
be helpful in guiding citizen science project design.

\section{THE FUTURE OF CITIZEN ASTRONOMY}
\label{sec:future}

% 1) Preamble: present picture of two communities, working with professionals.
% Concept of niches for citizens. 

During this review a picture has emerged of two types of very active and engaged
citizen astronomy community, which we might label observers and classifiers. 
Although these communities come together in differing ways (by self-assembly
through local groups linked by national and international networks, or by
joining online projects built by professional organisations), they have reached
a similar degree of internet-enabled connectedness, both with each other and
with the groups of professional astronomers with whom they  collaborate. They
also share the common motivation of being involved in, and contributing to,
science. In this section we look ahead, to the next decade or so, and discuss
the likely paths that citizen astronomy will take, as the available technology
advances and professional astronomy evolves. In it we try to identify the niches
that citizens might best occupy in this changing environment, and also some key
challenges that those who find themselves planning citizen science projects are
likely to have to face.

% domain and cosmology to faint limits. Networks of small telescopes, and 
% extremely large telescopes for follow-up. Niches: bright object observing. 
% Survey data mining, as part of human-machine partnership.

\subsection{The Future of Citizen Observing}

In professional astronomy, the wide field survey era is upon us: SDSS provided
the data for Galaxy Zoo, and other, larger surveys are planned or underway. Key
science drivers for projects such as LSST and the Square Kilometer Array include
mapping cosmological structure back into the reionisation era, and  further
opening the time domain; these will yield datasets of significantly increased
volume, throughput rates, and complexity.  Follow up observations of new
discoveries made at greater depths will be made with giant facilities such as
ALMA and the various planned Extremely Large Telescopes, while distributed
arrays of robotic telescopes, operating in remote regions with excellent
atmospheric conditions, and trained to observe a target in a regular fashion
over multiple nights will be able to take advantage of wealth of new transient
phenomena. 

These future advances in technology may in one sense widen the gap between
citizen scientists and professionals again. For example, networked telescopes
capable of quasi-continuous observations over 24 hour periods could be used to
develop a consistent high-quality dataset for cloud tracking on Venus, Mars or
the giant planets; as the images would be homogenous, we can envisage automated
software identifying morphological peculiarities over time, replacing the
crowd-sourced citizen analysis currently underway.  However, such an investment
would require both international funding and considerable time and effort: the
availability of citizen observers will remain a factor.

However, the advances in hardware becoming available to citizen observers
suggest other roles that they could play. Larger optics, more sensitive
cameras, and spectral coverage extending to longer wavelengths in the infrared
could permit citizen investigations of Uranus and Neptune, the Kuiper Belt
objects, and a wider variety of bright variable objects.  Transits of
extrasolar planets in front of their parent stars would be permitted from
modest observatories provided they had stable conditions.  New platforms might
also become available to the citizen scientist, including balloon-borne
observatories that provide crisper and more detailed observations of
astronomical targets. We can expect to see the networks of citizen deep sky
observers investigating new bright transients found in the wide field
surveys, while continuing to expand their own surveys.

Aside from pushing the observational boundaries, one challenge that amateur
astronomy may face is its own big data problem.   For example, solar system
video monitoring projects are likely to need automated feature detection of
some kind; other observing campaigns may also generate more data than is
easily manipulated. Will this community take to crowd-sourcing its visual
inspection? The Zooniverse platform is currently being redeveloped to enable
easy upload of images and launch of projects; such a facility may be used by
citizen scientists as well as by  professionals.

The point at which human review of data is no longer necessary has been
forecast for decades, but as we have seen above, the number of problems for
which manual review of images or data is still carried out is considerable.
Even if the proportion of data for which human inspection is necessary
decreases dramatically over the next decade (due to advances in automatic
analyses), the continued growth in the size of astronomical datasets should
ensure that there remains plenty for citizen scientists to do. Both LSST
\citep{LSSTsystem} and SKA scientists \citep{Norris}  have already considered
citizen science as part of their plans for analysis. As a precursor to
engaging with the latter project, Radio Galaxy
Zoo\footnote{\url{http://radio.galaxyzoo.org}} (Banfield et al in prep.)
demonstrates a citizen science project aimed at cross-identification of
sources between surveys at different wavelengths, a task that still requires
human but not necessarily expert intervention. Thinking about how to deal with
multiwavelength data will be critical for citizen science projects dealing
with the next generation of surveys. 

To understand the potential for citizen science in the era of extremely large
surveys, consider the example of optical transients. The LSST system overview
paper \citep{LSSTsystem} gives a conservative estimate of $10^5-10^6$ alerts
per night. Even if, after automated brokerage, only 1\% of these require human
classification, then that still might lead to $10^3-10^4$ objects requiring
inspection and interpretation every night -- roughly one every 10--100
seconds. Given the increased reliability, and likelihood of serendipitous
discovery, provided by citizen inspection, we should take seriously the
incorporation of open inspection into plans for LSST transients. Similar
arguments (with large error bars) can be made for other surveys: inspection of
transients for LOFAR already requires some human intervention \citep{LOFAR}. 

Implicit in this way of thinking is the sharing of work between human and
machine classifiers.  A simple example of human-machine task allocation was
mentioned in \Sref{sec:class:analysis}, where machine analysis of PTF images
identified those that contained candidate supernovae needing inspection by
volunteers. The inclusion of human inspection changed the nature of the
machine learning task: instead of optimising for purity (producing a small but
accurately classified set of candidates), the task for machine learning became
one of identifying a subset of the images which contained many false positives
but also a complete set of all supernovae.  In this example, human and machine
classification proceeded in series rather than in parallel, but more complex
interactions can be imagined. 

The accuracy of machine learning typically depends on the quality of the
training or ``gold standard'' data which can be provided for the problem in
question. Citizen science projects can assist by providing training sets which
are orders of magnitude larger than might otherwise have been available, while
work by \citet{Banerji++2010} established that the confidence intervals
provided by classifications from multiple volunteers can also improve machine
learning accuracy.  Predicting human responses (in the form of probabilities
of classification) is an easier task than straightforward sorting. We might
expect, therefore, intermediate-size surveys to benefit in the future from a
``citizen science phase,'' in which data is classified by volunteers prior to
the automation of the task. This pattern has already been followed by the PTF
supernova project discussed above, but perhaps it is more useful to think of
the citizen scientists as providing training sets on demand, so that as
conditions change from night to night, or the performance of the instrument
evolves over time, a small percentage of the total data is always processed by
humans in order to provide a constantly updated training set. 

If we are using classifications of gold standard data to assess the
performance of human classifiers, it is straightforward to include machine
classification in the same system. In this way, the task of classification
could be shared dynamically and in real time between machine and human
classifiers, improving the efficiency of the system. Significant work has
already been carried out for the nearly analogous problem of assigning tasks
to an ensemble of imperfect machine classifiers whose characteristics are
known  and for Mechanical Turk-like systems where a fixed payment is provided
for a task but the problem of adding in volunteers is significantly harder.
For the machine-only case, each classification task can be treated as having a
known cost (perhaps the processing time necessary for a given routine), but
when assigning tasks to  volunteers, who are able to leave whenever they like,
other costs must be taken into account. In order to create a viable system, it
is, in fact, necessary to measure how {\it interesting}  a task or set of
tasks is, and this requirement may conflict with the need for efficiency. As
an example, consider a Galaxy Zoo-like system which assigned the hardest
galaxies to the best classifiers. This would result in a steady diet of faint
fuzzy objects for the best classifiers; if they are motivated in part by the
variety of images seen, then such a system would tend to systematically drive
away its best classifiers. Nor is this problem necessarily resolved by simply
seeding the stream of data with impressive images; an informal study of
Snapshot Serengeti (Lynn, private communication) reveals that seeing more
impressive images early in a classifier's career (as measured by the number of
volunteers who added it to their list of favourites) tended to decrease the
number of classifications received from that volunteer in the long run,
presumably by setting up expectations for the rest of the data.

Considering individual classifications in isolation is clearly not sufficient;
the entirety of a volunteer's career must be considered when assigning tasks.
We should be wary of over-specialisation even when efficiency is paramount.
Complexities like these indicate a clear need for research into novel systems
for task assignment, in order to scale citizen science to the challenges of
the next generation of surveys.

\subsection{Advanced Citizen Activities in the Future}

As we have seen in previous sections, volunteers can and do move beyond simple
classification problems, and such behaviour could become increasingly
important as the volume and complexity of astronomical data continues to
increase.  We can imagine providing user-friendly, web-based tools enabling 
fairly sophisticated data analysis to be performed by anyone with a browser.
The experience documented above invites us to consider the possibility of
teams of citizens  performing analyses that currently require a significant
amount of research student time.  Checking survey images and catalogs  for
processing failures and fitting non-linear models to data are just two
possibilities. Just as research students adapt and develop the tools they are
first presented with, the Kaggle and Foldit experiences point strongly towards
a model where citizens are also enabled to adapt and extend their tools. Open
source tool code is a minimal requirement in this model; finding ways beyond
this to support citizen algorithm development seems to be likely to pay off.

In terms of supporting citizen-led enquiry, an example of best practice exists
in the way that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's \textit{sky server} provided
tools for both professional (or advanced) researchers alongside simplified
versions aimed primarily at educational use. This structure has the twin
benefits of providing near-seamless transitions from simple to more advanced
interfaces, and of providing extra pressure to make the resulting interfaces
easily usable  (something which benefits all users, not just citizen
scientists!). Designers of science user interfaces for upcoming large projects
would do well to bear these twin audiences in mind. Indeed, the more
citizen-accessible the interfaces to the upcoming public wide-field survey
databases can be made, the better chance we will give ourselves of enabling and
supporting ``bottom-up'' citizen science.   This term, introduced by Muki Haklay
and collaborators, represents an ambition to produce citizen science projects
that are driven by the participants. Moving beyond the `top down' structure of
most astronomical citizen science projects is, as we have shown, a significant
challenge -- but one that is, perhaps, worth taking on.

\subsection{The Future of Citizen Scientific Collaboration}

As well as enabling access to larger datasets,  citizen science projects
looking to engage larger crowds of volunteers will likely face   challenges of
another sort.  We might expect contributing to science via large international
public datasets to appeal to citizens of many nations: while translation of
project materials is simple,  coordinating a scientific \textit{discussion}
across multiple language barriers could prove difficult.  Having a critical
mass of professional scientists interacting with the citizens in each language
would seem the most important factor.

Even within a single language group, collaboration is difficult to achieve
with  very large numbers. In the large Zooniverse projects, a hierarchical
system of citizen discussion, with  moderators bridging the gap between
science teams and the crowd, has worked well, although it requires significant
commitment and effort from both the volunteer moderators and the professional
scientists involved.  The pay-off seems to be high, though:  as many of the
smaller-scale projects in this review have shown, citizen science works best
when professionals and amateurs work together as a strong collaboration. In
these small groups, collaboration is natural, and can lead to highly
productive teams. Scaling up to collaborations with ever larger crowds is a
significant challenge.

Access by citizens to professional scientists can be somewhat improved by
regular blog posts and webcasts, as many projects have found. Certainly these
can supply much-needed feedback as to the utility of the citizens' efforts, as
the professionals report on how the citizen-provided data is being used.  We
might also imagine regular broadcasts from the data-providing  projects as
playing a significant role in motivating and sustaining a crowd of volunteers,
and MOOC-style resources may help with training. However, for the foreseeable
future, astronomical surveys and other organisations will continue to seek to
use citizen science as a  way of \textit{expanding} the amount of science that
can be done; a short supply of committed and energetic professionals looking
to work with citizens could be a bottleneck. Another way to look at this is
that lareg-crowd projects which rely on significant intervention from small
numbers of professionals will likely fail. Focusing on designing systems which
can maximise scientific return and volunteer participation with manageable
levels of intervention seems necessary.

\section{CONCLUDING REMARKS}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Over the last two decades, citizen astronomy has undergone a period of rapid
growth, primarily due to the sharp increase in the ease with which people can
form communities and work together via the world-wide web.   A number of very
productive ``Pro-Am collaborations'' have formed in order to observe a variety
of bright astronomical objects in ways that capitalise on the flexibility,
availability and skill of the amateur observing community. Professional-led
visual classification projects have appeared, attracting three orders of
magnitude more citizens to the field than were previously engaged in amateur
observational research. Citizen-classified training sets have been used to
improve the performance of  machine learning approaches, suggesting that we
should think in terms of ``human-machine partnerships.'' Citizens have engaged
in data analysis tasks of increasing sophistication and difficulty, and
experimentation in professionally-guided online ``bottom up'' citizen research
has begun.  

In this review, we have consistently seen that the best citizen science in
astronomy has come from organised communities that have been asked to play to
their strengths, have been guided well by their professional collaborators,
and have been able to operate in niches insufficiently occupied by either
professional observers or automated classification software. The citizen
astronomers are passionate about their subject, and, encouragingly, are
motivated by being of service. We must recognize that a critical feature of
citizen science is the enabling of amateurs to make authentic contributions to
the research topic in question. This, in turn, should drive us to seek out
those tasks that cannot be performed by other means.  

The observational and classification citizen scientist communities are similar
in their diversity regarding both their motivation and their ability to
contribute;  this diversity means that good citizen science projects are ones
that provide both a low barrier to entry, but that also provide (or support
the development of) tools that enable their emergent experts to maximize their
contributions to science.  Indeed, the most dedicated volunteers have proved
capable of developing and using a variety of advanced astronomical techniques,
suggesting that we are likely to continue to see increasing numbers of
citizens co-authoring papers in high impact research journals. While not
everyone who takes part in a project wants to graduate to more advanced work,
providing the opportunity to do so is important.

Each of the case studies presented in this review has been an experiment in
citizen science: amateur and professional astronomers alike have had good
ideas for ways to make use of the public's skills and abilities, tried them
out, and  made progress in astronomy -- and in doing so revealed something
about how citizen science can work. Human potential is vast: citizen astronomy
seems to us to be an experiment well worth continuing.
